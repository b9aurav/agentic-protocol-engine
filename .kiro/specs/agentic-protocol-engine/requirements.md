# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agentic Protocol Engine (APE) is an open-source, AI-driven load testing tool that addresses the critical limitations of traditional load testing methods for complex, stateful cloud applications. Unlike conventional tools that rely on predefined, stateless scripts, APE simulates realistic, adaptive human user behavior across multi-step transactions using intelligent Large Language Model (LLM) agents powered by high-speed inference endpoints like Cerebras Llama 4 Scout.

The system deploys a farm of scalable, containerized LLM agents that execute dynamic, stateful decision-making in real-time, leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway to standardize interaction between agents and the target application. The key innovation lies in coupling accelerated inference speed with Docker-based standardization to enable unprecedented scale of intelligent traffic generation for rigorous system validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI-Driven Stateful Agent System

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want AI agents to simulate realistic user behavior with session context and adaptive decision-making, so that I can validate my application's performance under realistic load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a containerized Llama Agent instance with a specific user journey goal
2. WHEN an agent encounters an application response THEN the system SHALL maintain session context (cookies, JWT tokens, transaction IDs) in the agent's memory
3. WHEN an agent receives feedback from the SUT THEN the system SHALL adapt the next action based on the response (status codes, payload content)
4. WHEN an agent completes a multi-step transaction THEN the system SHALL log the successful stateful session completion
5. IF an agent encounters an error (401, 503, etc.) THEN the system SHALL dynamically decide on alternate sequences or recovery actions

### Requirement 2: High-Speed Inference Integration

**User Story:** As a load testing engineer, I want low-latency AI inference to maintain realistic timing between user actions, so that the simulation accurately reflects human interaction patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent needs to make a decision THEN the system SHALL use Cerebras Llama 4 Scout for inference with sub-second response times
2. WHEN measuring cognitive latency THEN the system SHALL achieve Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) metrics that enable Mean Time Between Actions (MTBA) of less than 1 second
3. WHEN scaling concurrent agents THEN the system SHALL maintain inference performance without degradation
4. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL log token usage, inference latency, and cost metrics

### Requirement 3: Standardized Protocol Mediation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized interface between AI agents and my application, so that I can easily configure load tests without modifying agent code for different target systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent makes a tool call THEN the system SHALL use the MCP Gateway to translate requests to standard HTTP/JSON format
2. WHEN configuring a new target application THEN the system SHALL allow routing configuration without agent code changes
3. WHEN an agent generates a request THEN the system SHALL enforce Pydantic schema validation for MCP-compliant JSON output
4. WHEN routing requests THEN the MCP Gateway SHALL support multiple target APIs with configurable endpoints
5. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL pass session headers (tokens, cookies) through the MCP Gateway

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Observability Framework

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want centralized logging and real-time metrics to validate simulation effectiveness and identify performance bottlenecks, so that I can prove the superiority of AI-driven load testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are running THEN the system SHALL collect logs from all containerized services using Promtail
2. WHEN processing logs THEN the system SHALL inject unique Session/Trace IDs for correlation across service boundaries
3. WHEN visualizing data THEN the system SHALL provide Grafana dashboards showing real-time agent metrics, error rates, and performance indicators
4. WHEN storing metrics THEN the system SHALL use Prometheus for infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, container counts)
5. WHEN containers terminate THEN the system SHALL ensure log data is preserved in centralized Loki storage
6. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL track Successful Stateful Sessions (%) as the primary success metric

### Requirement 5: User-Friendly CLI Distribution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily install and run load tests using simple commands, so that I can quickly validate my application's performance without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing APE THEN the system SHALL be available via `npx create-ape-test` command
2. WHEN setting up a new test THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive wizard for configuration
3. WHEN starting a load test THEN the system SHALL support `ape-test start --agents N` for dynamic scaling
4. WHEN generating configuration THEN the system SHALL create Docker Compose files, MCP Gateway routing, and environment files
5. WHEN managing tests THEN the system SHALL provide commands for log viewing, tracing specific sessions, and stopping tests

### Requirement 6: Scalable Container Architecture

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to scale load generation to thousands of concurrent agents, so that I can test my application's capacity limits effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scaling agents THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling via Docker Compose to 1000+ concurrent agents
2. WHEN deploying services THEN the system SHALL use a three-tier architecture (Agent Layer, Protocol Mediation Layer, Target Layer)
3. WHEN managing containers THEN the system SHALL ensure proper network configuration for agent-to-MCP-Gateway communication
4. WHEN monitoring resources THEN the system SHALL track concurrent active agents and resource utilization
5. WHEN containers are transient THEN the system SHALL handle rapid container creation/destruction without data loss

### Requirement 7: Stateful Session Management

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want agents to handle complex multi-step user journeys with proper state management, so that I can validate realistic user scenarios like login sequences and purchase flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a user journey THEN the agent SHALL maintain context across multiple API calls within a session
2. WHEN extracting state data THEN the agent SHALL capture and persist session tokens, cookies, and transaction IDs from responses
3. WHEN making subsequent requests THEN the agent SHALL include relevant session data in headers and payloads
4. WHEN updating context THEN the agent SHALL use Tool_State_Update to record session details for next decision
5. WHEN completing transactions THEN the agent SHALL demonstrate successful multi-step sequences (login → action → logout)

### Requirement 8: Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive error tracking and validation metrics, so that I can assess both the simulation quality and the target application's robustness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking errors THEN the system SHALL categorize HTTP response codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) and log error distributions
2. WHEN validating simulation quality THEN the system SHALL measure and report the percentage of successful stateful sessions
3. WHEN correlating events THEN the system SHALL link agent decisions, MCP Gateway actions, and SUT responses using trace IDs
4. WHEN detecting failures THEN the system SHALL distinguish between simulation errors and target application errors
5. WHEN reporting results THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights about application performance under realistic load
