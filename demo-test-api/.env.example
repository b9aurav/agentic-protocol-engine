# Demo Test API Configuration Template
# Copy this file to .env and modify values as needed

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
SESSION_SECRET=demo-secret-change-in-production

# Error Simulation Configuration
# Probability of 503 Service Unavailable responses (0.0 to 1.0)
ERROR_RATE_503=0.05

# Probability of 500 Internal Server Error responses (0.0 to 1.0)
ERROR_RATE_500=0.01

# Response Delay Configuration (in milliseconds)
# Minimum response delay for non-health endpoints
RESPONSE_DELAY_MIN=50

# Maximum response delay for non-health endpoints
RESPONSE_DELAY_MAX=200

# APE Integration Notes:
# - Health endpoints (/api/health, /api/status) are always fast regardless of delay settings
# - Error simulation does not apply to health endpoints
# - Session-based cart operations maintain state across requests
# - Realistic response times help simulate real-world API behavior
