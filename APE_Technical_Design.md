# **Technical Blueprint: Agentic Protocol Engine (APE) - An Open-Source, AI-Driven Load Testing Tool**

## **I. Executive Summary: The Agentic Protocol Engine (APE) MVP**

### **1.1 Project Overview and Strategic Value Proposition**

The proliferation of microservices and complex cloud applications necessitates a paradigm shift in performance validation. Traditional load testing methods, which rely on predefined, stateless scripts (e.g., repeating simple HTTP requests), fail fundamentally to replicate the non-linear, adaptive behavior of human users across multi-step transactions. This shortcoming leads to unreliable capacity planning and systemic failures when applications encounter realistic, stateful user journeys.

The proposed open-source tool, the Agentic Protocol Engine (APE), addresses this critical gap. APE is designed for easy distribution and use via a Node.js-based CLI, allowing developers to install and run it with a simple `npx` command. The system deploys a farm of scalable, containerized Large Language Model (LLM) agents, powered by high-speed inference endpoints like Cerebras llama3.1-8b. These agents execute dynamic, stateful decision-making in real-time. The project leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway to standardize interaction between the Llama Agents and the Cloud Application Under Test (SUT).1 The key innovation lies in the synergistic coupling of accelerated inference speed with the standardization afforded by the Docker MCP Gateway, enabling an unprecedented scale of

*intelligent* traffic generation necessary for rigorous system validation.

## **II. Strategic Rationale and Technical Stack Synergy**

### **2.1 Justification for AI-Driven Stateful Simulation**

The primary objective of the MVP is to move beyond the limitations of simple request repetition toward simulating complex, multi-stage human interaction sequences. An example of such complexity is a multi-step login sequence: remote logon via VPN, authentication via a jump server, attempted logon to an application server with an incorrect password, followed by a correct logon, file manipulation, and eventual logoff.3 Traditional load generators cannot reliably handle dynamic responses or adjust subsequent actions based on prior application feedback.

The requirement for stateful behavior inherently shifts the performance bottleneck from standard Input/Output (I/O) throughput to **cognitive latency**. In a stateful simulation, Agent Action A (e.g., attempting a login) must be immediately followed by Agent Decision B (e.g., deciding the next path based on the application's HTTP response code and payload). Decision B requires a near real-time inference call to the LLM (Cerebras llama3.1-8b). If this inference latency is high, the total simulated time between user actions (Mean Time Between Actions, MTBA) extends unrealistically, invalidating the simulation’s realism. Therefore, the ability of the Llama Agent to maintain session context and adapt its next action dynamically, using tools and feeding the response back into its context window, produces a far more realistic and insightful load profile than static scripts.

If an agent encounters an error, such as a 401 Unauthorized response during the login attempt, a traditional script either fails or retries blindly. A Llama Agent, however, can dynamically decide to log the specific failure with context, attempt an alternate sequence (e.g., registration), or query a tool for help before proceeding, thereby producing a richer, more accurate stress test that mimics sophisticated attack or usage patterns.3

### **2.2 The Cerebras Performance Imperative for Real-Time Agent Intelligence**

The requirement for rapid, stateful decision-making necessitates a highly responsive and scalable inference engine. The Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) is leveraged specifically because it tackles the core constraint: the need for fast, low-latency inference to minimize the delay between tool execution and the subsequent agent decision.

Cerebras operates based on the principle that "faster inference speed results in higher model intelligence".4 By significantly accelerating inference speed, the Llama Agent gains the necessary time within the real-time latency budget to utilize a greater number of tokens for complex reasoning, thereby enhancing the sophistication of its simulated behavior. 

## **III. Architectural Blueprint: The Containerized Simulation Grid**

The Agentic Protocol Engine (APE) employs a robust, logically segregated microservices architecture, orchestrated by a user-friendly CLI tool. The underlying services are designed for high scalability and rapid deployment using Docker Compose.

### **3.1 Three-Tier Architecture Definition**

The system is defined by its operational tiers, designed for modularity and specific function assignment:

1. **Agent Layer:** Composed of containerized Llama Agent instances. These stateless containers handle the execution of user goals, maintaining temporary session state (JWTs, context) within the running process memory, and coordinating tool calls.  
2. **Protocol Mediation Layer:** The Docker Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway. This critical central component standardizes the communication format between the complex LLM Agents and the external HTTP services (both the SUT and the Cerebras endpoint).  
3. **Target Layer:** This encompasses the Cloud Application (System Under Test, SUT) and the Cerebras llama3.1-8b Inference Engine, which provides the cognitive power.

The interaction protocols and performance expectations for these components are summarized below:

### **3.2 Defining the Role of the Docker MCP Gateway (Protocol Mediation)**

The Docker MCP Gateway is vital for providing a uniform, standardized interface between the LLM Agents and the external services, especially the Target Cloud Application.1 Deploying the MCP Gateway addresses the challenge of making AI applications, specifically the Llama Agents, work across multiple endpoints simultaneously by standardizing the tool interaction.1

This protocol mediation function creates a crucial **decoupling layer** that significantly enhances test configurability and security. The agent does not need intimate knowledge of the SUT’s networking intricacies, authentication methods, or specific deployment details (hostnames, ports). Instead, it generates a structured request conforming precisely to the MCP standard, defining the intent of the action.

The required MCP input schema mandates that the Llama Agent’s structured output includes specific parameters for routing and execution.7 The agent must generate a precise JSON object containing:

* api\_name: The identifier for the target API service.  
* method: The required HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).  
* path: The API endpoint path (e.g., /api/checkout).  
* data: The optional request body payload, typically a JSON object.7

This isolation allows the technical team to swap out the SUT or change the networking configuration rapidly—a crucial benefit in a fast-paced environment—without necessitating any code change or retraining of the Llama Agents. The MCP Gateway serves as an immutable service contract. Furthermore, centralizing this function ensures that all agent-driven traffic is routed through a single point, dramatically simplifying the collection of comprehensive request metadata for subsequent performance analysis.8

## **IV. Llama Agent Design for Realistic Stateful Behavior**

### **4.1 Agent Architecture and Tool Definition**

Llama Agents are deployed as dedicated Docker containers, each initialized with a specific user journey goal and responsible for executing one simulated stateful user session. The architecture leverages the LlamaIndex framework, specifically the CustomSimpleAgentWorker. This framework is ideal for the MVP because it efficiently sets up the required scaffolding, including tool management, the LLM connection, and a callback manager, and operates under the assumption of a sequential execution model.9

To interact with the environment through the MCP Gateway, the Llama Agent must be equipped with specialized tools that translate its decisions into MCP-compliant API calls:

* **Tool\_HTTP\_GET**: Executes a read-only request by formatting the necessary method='GET' and path for the MCP Gateway.  
* **Tool\_HTTP\_POST**: Executes write actions (e.g., login, form submission, purchasing) by formatting method='POST' along with the required data payload.  
* **Tool\_State\_Update**: An internal, non-external tool used solely by the agent to record transient session details (e.g., a session token, current basket ID, or successful login status) into its persistent context window, preparing the LLM for the next decision.

### **4.2 Implementing Statefulness and Context Management**

The realization of realistic traffic depends on maintaining context persistence throughout the user session. For complex sequences, such as a multi-stage checkout or the detailed system logon path described previously 3, the agent must extract and persist critical state variables (e.g., HTTP cookies, JWT tokens, transaction IDs) from the SUT’s response.

This extracted state data must be immediately fed back into the LLM’s context window for the subsequent inference call. This guarantees that the LLM's next decision is informed by the current application state. The sequential execution loop is critical:

1. **Goal Assignment:** The Agent receives a high-level goal (e.g., "Complete a purchase of Product X").  
2. **LLM Decision (Inference):** The LLM uses the current context to decide which tool to call (e.g., Tool\_HTTP\_POST) and generates the required parameters.  
3. **Execution (MCP Call):** The tool translates the parameters into the MCP-compatible JSON and submits the request to the MCP Gateway.  
4. **Feedback Loop:** The SUT's response (including status codes, body content, and headers) is returned via the MCP Gateway.  
5. **State Update:** The Agent processes the feedback (e.g., extracts a session token from the response headers) and updates its internal context via the Tool\_State\_Update tool.  
6. **Next Decision:** The loop restarts, with the LLM using the newly updated context to determine the next logically informed stateful action.

### **4.3 Detailed JSON Schemas for Agent-to-MCP Communication**

To ensure system stability, the Llama Agent’s output parser must be rigidly constrained. Leveraging the structured output capabilities (e.g., Pydantic schemas) available in LlamaIndex 9 is paramount. This guarantees that the LLM’s output—the required tool call—adheres perfectly to the MCP Gateway’s expected request format.7

The enforcement of a Pydantic schema on the agent output is the single most critical technical decision for the MVP's reliability. If an unconstrained LLM output is used, the risk of generating non-conforming or hallucinated JSON tool calls is high. Since the MCP Gateway requires a precise structure (method, path, etc.) 7, a malformed request generated by the agent will cause the MCP Gateway to fail immediately with a parsing error, rather than producing a meaningful load test result on the SUT. By mandating Pydantic adherence, reliability is maximized, and the validity of the simulated traffic data is guaranteed.
