# **Technical Blueprint: Agentic Protocol Engine (APE) - An Open-Source, AI-Driven Load Testing Tool**

## **I. Executive Summary: The Agentic Protocol Engine (APE) MVP**

### **1.1 Project Overview and Strategic Value Proposition**

The proliferation of microservices and complex cloud applications necessitates a paradigm shift in performance validation. Traditional load testing methods, which rely on predefined, stateless scripts (e.g., repeating simple HTTP requests), fail fundamentally to replicate the non-linear, adaptive behavior of human users across multi-step transactions. This shortcoming leads to unreliable capacity planning and systemic failures when applications encounter realistic, stateful user journeys.

The proposed open-source tool, the Agentic Protocol Engine (APE), addresses this critical gap. APE is designed for easy distribution and use via a Node.js-based CLI, allowing developers to install and run it with a simple `npx` command. The system deploys a farm of scalable, containerized Large Language Model (LLM) agents, powered by high-speed inference endpoints like Cerebras Llama 4 Scout. These agents execute dynamic, stateful decision-making in real-time. The project leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway to standardize interaction between the Llama Agents and the Cloud Application Under Test (SUT).1 The key innovation lies in the synergistic coupling of accelerated inference speed with the standardization afforded by the Docker MCP Gateway, enabling an unprecedented scale of

*intelligent* traffic generation necessary for rigorous system validation.

## **II. Strategic Rationale and Technical Stack Synergy**

### **2.1 Justification for AI-Driven Stateful Simulation**

The primary objective of the MVP is to move beyond the limitations of simple request repetition toward simulating complex, multi-stage human interaction sequences. An example of such complexity is a multi-step login sequence: remote logon via VPN, authentication via a jump server, attempted logon to an application server with an incorrect password, followed by a correct logon, file manipulation, and eventual logoff.3 Traditional load generators cannot reliably handle dynamic responses or adjust subsequent actions based on prior application feedback.

The requirement for stateful behavior inherently shifts the performance bottleneck from standard Input/Output (I/O) throughput to **cognitive latency**. In a stateful simulation, Agent Action A (e.g., attempting a login) must be immediately followed by Agent Decision B (e.g., deciding the next path based on the application's HTTP response code and payload). Decision B requires a near real-time inference call to the LLM (Cerebras Llama 4 Scout). If this inference latency is high, the total simulated time between user actions (Mean Time Between Actions, MTBA) extends unrealistically, invalidating the simulation’s realism. Therefore, the ability of the Llama Agent to maintain session context and adapt its next action dynamically, using tools and feeding the response back into its context window, produces a far more realistic and insightful load profile than static scripts.

If an agent encounters an error, such as a 401 Unauthorized response during the login attempt, a traditional script either fails or retries blindly. A Llama Agent, however, can dynamically decide to log the specific failure with context, attempt an alternate sequence (e.g., registration), or query a tool for help before proceeding, thereby producing a richer, more accurate stress test that mimics sophisticated attack or usage patterns.3

### **2.2 The Cerebras Performance Imperative for Real-Time Agent Intelligence**

The requirement for rapid, stateful decision-making necessitates a highly responsive and scalable inference engine. The Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) is leveraged specifically because it tackles the core constraint: the need for fast, low-latency inference to minimize the delay between tool execution and the subsequent agent decision.

Cerebras operates based on the principle that "faster inference speed results in higher model intelligence".4 By significantly accelerating inference speed, the Llama Agent gains the necessary time within the real-time latency budget to utilize a greater number of tokens for complex reasoning, thereby enhancing the sophistication of its simulated behavior. The WSE architecture is particularly well-suited for accelerating LLM training and inference, utilizing 850,000 cores, 40 GB of uniformly distributed on-chip memory, and a 20 PB/s high-bandwidth memory fabric designed to overcome the memory-wall associated with traditionally memory-bound compute tasks.5

This hardware design provides crucial architectural benefits for the MVP. Cerebras Inference achieves up to a **30x faster inference rate** and superior price-performance compared to typical GPU clouds.2 This speed advantage is not merely a budget optimization; it functions as a critical enabler for scaling the number of concurrent, intelligent agents. For the MVP, this speed allows the Cerebras endpoint to function as a shared, highly centralized resource capable of serving hundreds, or potentially thousands, of simultaneously containerized Llama Agents without succumbing to the high context-switching latency typical of heavily loaded GPU clusters. The Cerebras Llama 4 Scout, compatible with standard APIs like the OpenAI Chat Completions API 6, can be seamlessly integrated using LlamaIndex wrappers, bypassing complex, highly customized API handling at the individual agent level.

## **III. Architectural Blueprint: The Containerized Simulation Grid**

The Agentic Protocol Engine (APE) employs a robust, logically segregated microservices architecture, orchestrated by a user-friendly CLI tool. The underlying services are designed for high scalability and rapid deployment using Docker Compose.

### **3.1 Three-Tier Architecture Definition**

The system is defined by its operational tiers, designed for modularity and specific function assignment:

1. **Agent Layer:** Composed of containerized Llama Agent instances. These stateless containers handle the execution of user goals, maintaining temporary session state (JWTs, context) within the running process memory, and coordinating tool calls.  
2. **Protocol Mediation Layer:** The Docker Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway. This critical central component standardizes the communication format between the complex LLM Agents and the external HTTP services (both the SUT and the Cerebras endpoint).  
3. **Target Layer:** This encompasses the Cloud Application (System Under Test, SUT) and the Cerebras Llama 4 Scout Inference Engine, which provides the cognitive power.

The interaction protocols and performance expectations for these components are summarized below:

Table I: Core Component Mapping and Interconnection Protocol

| Component | Primary Function | Technology Link | Critical Performance Metric |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cerebras Llama 4 Scout | High-Speed Inference (Agent Decisioning) | Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) / Low Latency | Token Generation Rate (T/s) |
| Containerized Llama Agents | Stateful User Behavior Simulation | LlamaIndex/Docker | Stateful Session Completion Rate |
| Docker MCP Gateway | Protocol Translation & Request Routing | HTTP/JSON Schema | API Call Latency (Agent-to-Target) |
| Target Cloud Application (SUT) | System Under Test | HTTP/S | Application Response Time (ART) |

### **3.2 Defining the Role of the Docker MCP Gateway (Protocol Mediation)**

The Docker MCP Gateway is vital for providing a uniform, standardized interface between the LLM Agents and the external services, especially the Target Cloud Application.1 Deploying the MCP Gateway addresses the challenge of making AI applications, specifically the Llama Agents, work across multiple endpoints simultaneously by standardizing the tool interaction.1

This protocol mediation function creates a crucial **decoupling layer** that significantly enhances test configurability and security. The agent does not need intimate knowledge of the SUT’s networking intricacies, authentication methods, or specific deployment details (hostnames, ports). Instead, it generates a structured request conforming precisely to the MCP standard, defining the intent of the action.

The required MCP input schema mandates that the Llama Agent’s structured output includes specific parameters for routing and execution.7 The agent must generate a precise JSON object containing:

* api\_name: The identifier for the target API service.  
* method: The required HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).  
* path: The API endpoint path (e.g., /api/checkout).  
* data: The optional request body payload, typically a JSON object.7

This isolation allows the technical team to swap out the SUT or change the networking configuration rapidly—a crucial benefit in a fast-paced environment—without necessitating any code change or retraining of the Llama Agents. The MCP Gateway serves as an immutable service contract. Furthermore, centralizing this function ensures that all agent-driven traffic is routed through a single point, dramatically simplifying the collection of comprehensive request metadata for subsequent performance analysis.8

## **IV. Llama Agent Design for Realistic Stateful Behavior**

### **4.1 Agent Architecture and Tool Definition**

Llama Agents are deployed as dedicated Docker containers, each initialized with a specific user journey goal and responsible for executing one simulated stateful user session. The architecture leverages the LlamaIndex framework, specifically the CustomSimpleAgentWorker. This framework is ideal for the MVP because it efficiently sets up the required scaffolding, including tool management, the LLM connection, and a callback manager, and operates under the assumption of a sequential execution model.9

To interact with the environment through the MCP Gateway, the Llama Agent must be equipped with specialized tools that translate its decisions into MCP-compliant API calls:

* **Tool\_HTTP\_GET**: Executes a read-only request by formatting the necessary method='GET' and path for the MCP Gateway.  
* **Tool\_HTTP\_POST**: Executes write actions (e.g., login, form submission, purchasing) by formatting method='POST' along with the required data payload.  
* **Tool\_State\_Update**: An internal, non-external tool used solely by the agent to record transient session details (e.g., a session token, current basket ID, or successful login status) into its persistent context window, preparing the LLM for the next decision.

### **4.2 Implementing Statefulness and Context Management**

The realization of realistic traffic depends on maintaining context persistence throughout the user session. For complex sequences, such as a multi-stage checkout or the detailed system logon path described previously 3, the agent must extract and persist critical state variables (e.g., HTTP cookies, JWT tokens, transaction IDs) from the SUT’s response.

This extracted state data must be immediately fed back into the LLM’s context window for the subsequent inference call. This guarantees that the LLM's next decision is informed by the current application state. The sequential execution loop is critical:

1. **Goal Assignment:** The Agent receives a high-level goal (e.g., "Complete a purchase of Product X").  
2. **LLM Decision (Inference):** The LLM uses the current context to decide which tool to call (e.g., Tool\_HTTP\_POST) and generates the required parameters.  
3. **Execution (MCP Call):** The tool translates the parameters into the MCP-compatible JSON and submits the request to the MCP Gateway.  
4. **Feedback Loop:** The SUT's response (including status codes, body content, and headers) is returned via the MCP Gateway.  
5. **State Update:** The Agent processes the feedback (e.g., extracts a session token from the response headers) and updates its internal context via the Tool\_State\_Update tool.  
6. **Next Decision:** The loop restarts, with the LLM using the newly updated context to determine the next logically informed stateful action.

### **4.3 Detailed JSON Schemas for Agent-to-MCP Communication**

To ensure system stability, the Llama Agent’s output parser must be rigidly constrained. Leveraging the structured output capabilities (e.g., Pydantic schemas) available in LlamaIndex 9 is paramount. This guarantees that the LLM’s output—the required tool call—adheres perfectly to the MCP Gateway’s expected request format.7

The enforcement of a Pydantic schema on the agent output is the single most critical technical decision for the MVP's reliability. If an unconstrained LLM output is used, the risk of generating non-conforming or hallucinated JSON tool calls is high. Since the MCP Gateway requires a precise structure (method, path, etc.) 7, a malformed request generated by the agent will cause the MCP Gateway to fail immediately with a parsing error, rather than producing a meaningful load test result on the SUT. By mandating Pydantic adherence, reliability is maximized, and the validity of the simulated traffic data is guaranteed.

The Llama Agent output must map directly to the MCP Gateway’s input parameters, including provisions for managing session state through HTTP headers:

Table II: Llama Agent Pydantic Output Schema vs. MCP Input

| Llama Agent Pydantic Field | Data Type | MCP Gateway Parameter | Significance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| target\_api\_name | str | api\_name | Target SUT identifier for routing. |
| http\_method | str | method | Required HTTP operation (GET/POST).7 |
| endpoint\_path | str | path | Specific API endpoint path.7 |
| request\_payload | dict | data | Request body data, if applicable.7 |
| session\_headers | dict | headers | Crucial for statefulness (e.g., session token, cookies). |

## **V. Distribution and User Interface: The APE CLI**

### **5.1 The `npx` Command for Zero-Hassle Setup**

To ensure maximum accessibility and ease of use, APE is packaged as a command-line tool executable with `npx`. This approach abstracts away the underlying Docker Compose complexity, guiding the user through an interactive setup process.

A user will initiate a new test setup by running a command like `npx create-ape-test`. This command triggers a setup wizard that asks for key configuration details (e.g., the target application's Docker image and port). It then generates the necessary configuration files, using the `ape.` prefix for clarity. The wizard can either generate default files or incorporate user-provided ones.

*   **`ape.docker-compose.yml`**: The main Docker Compose file defining all services.
*   **`ape.mcp-gateway.json`**: The crucial routing configuration for the MCP Gateway, mapping logical `api_name` values to the actual service URLs.
*   **`ape.prompt.md` (Optional)**: The detailed instructional prompt for the Llama Agents. The setup wizard will generate this file unless the user provides a path to an existing API documentation or prompt file.
*   **`ape.env` (Optional)**: An environment file for passing dynamic parameters. This is generated if the user provides key-value pairs for dynamic goals (e.g., user credentials, specific product IDs).

The generated `ape.docker-compose.yml` file will define all necessary services for the simulation grid:

1. **cerebras\_proxy**: An internal service endpoint configured to communicate with the actual Cerebras Llama 4 Scout inference system (or a mock API for local testing).  
2. **mcp\_gateway**: The Docker MCP Gateway container, acting as the central traffic broker.  
3. **sut\_target**: A simplified container representing the Target Cloud Application Under Test (SUT).  
4. **llama\_agent**: The core service, built from the Llama Agent logic image, configured for horizontal scaling.  
5. **observability\_stack**: A set of containers dedicated to centralized logging and metrics (Loki, Prometheus, Grafana).

The network configuration within the docker-compose.yml file must explicitly define an internal bridge network, ensuring that all llama\_agent containers can efficiently route their tool-call traffic to the mcp\_gateway service endpoint, which in turn communicates with both the sut\_target and the cerebras\_proxy.

### **5.2 Simplified Test Execution and Scaling**

The APE CLI provides simple, intuitive commands to manage the load test. These commands act as a user-friendly wrapper around Docker Compose.

Bash

ape-test start --agents N

This command abstracts the underlying `docker-compose up --scale llama_agent=N -d` command, providing immediate and demonstrable load scaling. For instance, issuing

`ape-test start --agents 1000` would immediately attempt to launch 1,000 stateful user sessions. The architectural goal is to define the maximum scale (N) that successfully stresses the SUT to its breaking point while maintaining the desired low Mean Time Between Actions (MTBA), proving the massive throughput capability of the underlying inference engine.

### **5.3 Automated Configuration and Logging**

Rapid scaling via Docker Compose introduces the significant challenge of managing high volumes of transient log data. Containers are, by definition, transient resources; they are frequently destroyed upon completion of their operation or when scaling down.12 In a heavy load test, if the scale reaches 1,000 agents, many of these containers will complete their assigned stateful goal quickly and shut down, resulting in massive, short bursts of log data.

If standard Docker logging drivers are used without proper configuration, critical stateful session logs—which contain the evidence of the agent's decision steps and tool use 3—will be lost upon container teardown. To mitigate this high risk of data loss, the Docker Compose environment must be configured to use logging drivers (e.g., GELF or Fluentd) that enforce immediate streaming of all container output to a centralized logging endpoint (e.g., Loki or Logstash). This mandatory configuration ensures that every event, particularly those detailing successful or failed stateful steps, is captured before the transient container is removed.8

## **VI. Observability Framework and Simulation Validation**

### **6.1 Requirement for Centralized, Real-Time Logging and Metrics**

Validation of the MVP relies entirely on robust, centralized observability. This framework must validate both the functional realism (stateful completion) and the operational efficiency (low cognitive latency). Given the dynamic and transient nature of the container environment, continuous, centralized log collection and correlation are non-negotiable.8

The required observability flow adheres to established best practices:

1. **Collection:** Lightweight container agents (e.g., Sematext agents 13, Promtail, or cAdvisor 12) are deployed to collect metrics and logs natively from the host system, the dynamic agent farm, and the MCP Gateway, providing comprehensive observability.13  
2. **Processing:** Raw logs must be transformed into a usable, structured format, often by adding standardized fields like trace IDs and ensuring consistent formats for indexing.8  
3. **Indexing:** Logs are stored and indexed centrally (e.g., using Loki for fast indexing or Elasticsearch) to allow for quick searching, analysis, and the critical ability to connect events across multiple services.8  
4. **Visualization:** Grafana is paired with Prometheus (for metrics) and Loki (for logs) to display simulation KPIs and provide real-time dashboards.10

### **6.2 Key Simulation Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Traceability**

To prove the superiority of the AI simulation, the validation must move beyond simple throughput metrics. It requires correlating three distinct layers of data: the agent’s decision-making (Llama Agent Log), the protocol mediation (MCP Gateway Log), and the application impact (SUT Log).

This correlation requires a distributed tracing approach, even if simplified for the MVP. The Llama Agent must be programmed to inject a unique **Session/Trace ID** into the HTTP headers of the first request sent to the MCP Gateway. The MCP Gateway must be configured to guarantee this header is passed unchanged to the SUT. This mechanism links the LLM’s initial decision and the entire subsequent chain of stateful actions to the SUT’s final response.

The following metrics are essential for validating the simulation's effectiveness and speed:

Table III: Key Simulation Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Data Targets

| KPI Category | Metric Target | Data Source | Logging Requirement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Agent Effectiveness** | Successful Stateful Sessions (%) | Llama Agent Log | Correlation of sequential steps (Trace ID). |
| **Inference Latency** | Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) | Cerebras Endpoint Logs | High-Resolution decision time profile. |
| **Load Volume** | Concurrent Active Agents | Docker/Orchestration Metrics 13 | Container count and resource utilization (CPU/Memory). |
| **Application Health** | Error Rates (5xx, 4xx) | Target Cloud App/MCP Logs 8 | Centralized indexing and visualization of response codes. |
| **Simulation Speed** | Mean Time Between Actions (MTBA) | Llama Agent Log | Validation of realism (must be \< 1 second). |

The most critical metric is the **Successful Stateful Sessions (%)**. Proving the completion of complex, multi-step sessions (e.g., the sequence described in 3) via correlated logs is the ultimate demonstration of the MVP’s value. If the logging solution fails to capture the necessary distributed traces, the entire validation of realism and stateful capacity fails, regardless of the underlying speed of the Cerebras inference.

### **6.3 Tool Selection for Integrated Observability**

For a distributable tool, the selection criteria for observability tools prioritizes automated setup, comprehensive integration, and low overhead.13

The recommended stack is a consolidated Loki (logging), Prometheus (metrics), and Grafana (visualization) suite, deployed as part of the primary docker-compose.yml. This configuration, often referred to as the "Loki Stack," is highly configurable and natively suited for collecting data from dynamic, transient containers.10

Specific agent deployment recommendations:

* **Logging:** Deploying Promtail configured to capture logs via the configured Docker logging driver and forward them to Loki.  
* **Metrics:** Deploying cAdvisor and Node Exporter to gather infrastructure and container-specific resource utilization data (CPU, memory, container count) and expose it to Prometheus.12

This lightweight strategy ensures that the essential visibility into the simulation layer (Agents and MCP Gateway) is prioritized. The primary goal is to prove the realism and scalability of the *generated traffic*, making the observability of the agent behavior more crucial than the deep introspection of the SUT itself. This centralized platform enables quick debugging and validation of the low MTBA metric, confirming that the Cerebras Llama 4 Scout is effectively mitigating cognitive latency and delivering realistic simulation speeds.

## **VII. Conclusion and Future Roadmap**

### **7.1 Success Metrics Summary**

The tool will be deemed successful based on the following demonstrable achievements:

* **Ease of Use:** A developer can successfully initialize, configure, and run a load test against their own application using the `npx` command and its interactive prompts.
* **Scalability:** Successfully demonstrating dynamic load generation, scaling the Llama Agent farm to a high concurrent capacity (e.g., reaching 1,000 concurrent agents) via the CLI.11
* **Performance:** Validating low cognitive latency, evidenced by a calculated Mean Time Between Actions (MTBA) of less than 1 second, directly attributed to the speed of the configured inference system.2
* **Realism:** Proof of successful, complex, multi-step session completion across a statistically significant sample of agents, validated through the analysis of centralized, correlated logs (Trace ID validation).3

### **7.2 Recommendations for Productionizing the Platform**

While the initial open-source release will be powerful, transitioning to a more enterprise-grade platform requires further refinement:

* **Migration to Kubernetes (K8s):** The system must migrate from simple Docker Compose scaling 11 to a Kubernetes cluster. K8s provides true elastic scale, advanced self-healing, resilience, and superior resource management capabilities necessary for sustained, high-volume load testing.  
* **Advanced APM and Distributed Tracing Integration:** The current simplified tracing must be upgraded to integrate with full Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools and modern distributed tracing platforms (e.g., Jaeger/OpenTelemetry). This provides deeper, end-to-end introspection into the SUT’s internal processing paths, complementing the surface-level metrics collected by the MCP Gateway.12  
* **LLM Fine-Tuning and Adversarial Modeling:** To maximize simulation realism, the Llama Agent instructions or the underlying Llama 4 Scout model should be continuously refined. This includes fine-tuning the model to handle a wider array of application error responses, complex redirection logic, and non-deterministic state changes, thereby maximizing the intelligence and fidelity of the simulated traffic patterns.
